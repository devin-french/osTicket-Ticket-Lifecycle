  To create tickets, users must access the ticket portal and log in if required. Once inside the portal, they can submit a ticket request and provide a description of their IT-related issue. Below, I’ve drafted three example tickets, each addressing different types of problems that might arise in a real-world setting. These tickets are made by selecting a Help Topic, writing a clear summary of the issue, and providing detailed information, all formatted as if it were an email.

From an admin's perspective, once ticket requests are submitted, they will appear in their dashboard. The admin can then assign the tickets to the relevant agent or team. The severity level of each issue is assessed and set to ensure that critical tickets are addressed within the required Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this case, Jane reviewed the ticket, reassigned it to the System Administrators, and updated the severity to Emergency.

Effective communication is key when resolving tickets. It's essential to stay in touch with both the team and the users impacted by the issue. Tickets vary in nature and are assigned to the right individuals based on the specific problem. For example, one ticket was reassigned to John by Jane, while Jane successfully handled another ticket on her own. Proper documentation is vital for a smooth workflow. Each ticket should be thoroughly documented to serve as a useful reference in case similar issues arise in the future.
